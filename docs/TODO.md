# Things To Do

_This file started off with good intentions, but I never got around to updating it. Instead, I've been using the [shopping list integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/shopping_list/) to make notes on what I'd like to implement. For now, I will leave this file, but it is essentially marked for deletion at this point (along with a lot of commented out code that I will go through eventually)._

This file will lay out a roadmap of how I plan on progressing my configuration
as time goes on. I'm going to break this into some basic categories of tasks,
goals, and projects. From there, I will create issues on GitHub and try to
tackle them one by one. Not a great method, but I have no idea what I'm doing.

- Migrate instance to Ubuntu 20.04
- Setup Xiaomi Aquara
