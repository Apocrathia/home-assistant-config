# Things To Do
This file will lay out a roadmap of how I plan on progressing my configuration
as time goes on. I'm going to break this into some basic categories of tasks,
goals, and projects. From there, I will create issues on GitHub and try to
tackle them one by one. Not a great method, but I have no idea what I'm doing.

- Migrate instance to Ubuntu 20.04
- Setup Xiaomi Aquara
