# Home Assistant Packages Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the organization and structure of our Home Assistant packages. The configuration uses a modular approach through Home Assistant's packages feature, allowing for better organization and maintenance of the configuration.

## Directory Structure

```

```

## Package Types

### Areas (`areas/`)

Location-specific configurations for different spaces in the home. Each area package contains:

- Light configurations
- Room-specific automations
- Area-specific sensors
- Scene definitions

Examples: `back_yard.yaml`, `office.yaml`, `master_bathroom.yaml`

### Functions (`functions/`)

Modules that handle specific types of functionality across different areas:

- Energy management
- HVAC control
- Dimmer and remote control systems
- Security features

Examples: `energy.yaml`, `hvac.yaml`, `dimmer_remote.yaml`

### Projects (`projects/`)

Special integrations for specific projects:

- Mycology monitoring
- Aquaponics system
- Automated blinds
- Each project package contains all related sensors, automations, and configurations

### Routines (`routines/`)

Time-based and routine task configurations:

- Morning routines
- Work schedules
- Evening sequences
- Vacation modes

### System (`system/`)

Core system management features:

- Backup configurations
- System health monitoring
- Maintenance automations
- Core service configurations

## Best Practices

1. Keep each package focused on a single responsibility
2. Use clear, descriptive names for all entities
3. Document dependencies between packages
4. Include comments for complex automations
5. Test configurations before deploying to production

## Adding New Packages

To add a new package:

1. Identify the appropriate category
2. Create a new YAML file in the corresponding directory
3. Follow the naming convention: `<category>_<description>.yaml`
4. Include necessary documentation within the file
5. Test the configuration before deploying

## Common Patterns

- Use `!include` statements for shared configurations
- Leverage templates for reusable logic
- Implement proper error handling
- Use meaningful names for entities and automations
