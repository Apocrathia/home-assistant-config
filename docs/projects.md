# Special Projects Documentation

## Overview

This document details the special project integrations in our Home Assistant setup. These projects represent custom solutions for specific use cases, combining various sensors, automations, and integrations.

## Current Projects

### Mycology Project

Location: `packages/projects/mycology.yaml`

A monitoring and control system for mycology cultivation:

- Environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity)
- Growth condition automation
- Alert system for condition deviations
- Data logging and analysis

### Aquaponics System

Location: `packages/projects/aquaponics.yaml`

Automated aquaponics system management:

- Water quality monitoring
- Feeding schedules
- Pump control
- Environmental parameters
- Alert system for critical conditions

### Automated Blinds

Location: `packages/projects/blinds.yaml`

Smart blind control system:

- Schedule-based operation
- Light level responsiveness
- Temperature optimization
- Manual override options
- Scene integration

## Project Structure

Each project package follows a consistent structure:

```yaml
# Project Configuration Template
sensor:
  # Project-specific sensors
automation:
  # Project-specific automations
binary_sensor:
  # Status sensors
script:
  # Reusable scripts
input_boolean:
  # Control switches
template:
  # Custom sensors and calculations
alert:
  # Warning systems
```

## Integration with Core System

- Projects can be enabled/disabled via input_boolean helpers
- Data is stored in InfluxDB for long-term analysis
- Notifications are sent through the central notification system
- Projects are integrated with the main dashboard

## Adding New Projects

1. Create a new file in `packages/projects/`
2. Follow the project structure template
3. Document dependencies and requirements
4. Include setup instructions
5. Add monitoring and alerting
6. Create project-specific dashboard views

## Best Practices

1. Keep project configurations isolated
2. Include proper error handling
3. Document all sensors and entities
4. Implement appropriate safety measures
5. Include backup procedures
6. Test thoroughly before deployment

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Each project should include:

- Health check sensors
- Status indicators
- Error logging
- Regular maintenance schedules
- Backup procedures

## Future Projects

Consider documenting:

- Project ideas
- Required hardware
- Implementation plans
- Expected challenges
- Resource requirements
