### Lovelace ###

# Credit to github.com/basnijholt/home-assistant-config

# Commenting out for now. The filesize sensor does not want to work with
# the Lovelace JSON file, and I don't want to expose it
# via allowlist_external_dirs

# sensor:
#   - platform: filesize
#     file_paths:
#       - .storage/lovelace

# automation:
#   - alias: "System - Lovelace - Update"
#     trigger:
#       platform: state
#       entity_id: sensor.lovelace
#     action:
#       service: shell_command.convert_lovelace
