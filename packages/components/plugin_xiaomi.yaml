# Roborock Vacuums

# The vacuums are rooted and running Valetudo-RE for granular local control and
# separation from the Xiaomi cloud. Plus, I can get the maps in lovelace.
# I've used the mirobo tool to upload firmware built by vacuumz.info
# mirobo --ip 192.168.8.1 --token $$$ update-firmware ~/Downloads/root_1886.pkg
# Vacuumz.info - https://vacuumz.info/download/gen2/stock_root/
# mirobo - https://github.com/rytilahti/python-miio
# ValetudoRE - https://github.com/rand256/Valetudo/
# Eventually, I want to migrate to either using DustBuilder or zvldz's firmware
# builder script directly. I'm still running 1886, and I'd like to update to
# the new (currently 2008) version. Although, I don't know if there's a huge
# benefit to doing this yet, other than the new room cleaning feature.

vacuum:
  - platform: xiaomi_miio
    name: Downstairs Vacuum
    entity_id: downstairs_vacuum
    host: !secret downstairs_vacuum_host
    token: !secret downstairs_vacuum_token
    
  - platform: xiaomi_miio

    token: !secret upstairs_vacuum_token

# Both of these devices are also being populated in Home Assistant
# via MQTT auto-discovery, which I may or may not utilize in the future.
# I like that the miio protocol does not rely on an MQTT broker.
# The devices get populated as 'vacuum.downstairs' & 'vacuum.upstairs'
# which is a little less redundant than 'vacuum.downstairs_vacuum' etc.
# I don't know how I'll proceed. I'm just making notes for future me.

# For drawing the map in Lovelace, I am using the Valetudo map card
# https://github.com/TheLastProject/lovelace-valetudo-map-card
# The following sensor configuration is required.
# sensor:
#   - platform: mqtt
#     state_topic: "vacuum/upstairs/state"
#     json_attributes_topic: "vacuum/upstairs/map_data_parsed"
#     name: Upstairs Vacuum Map
#     value_template: 'OK'
#     # scan_interval: 5
#   - platform: mqtt
#     state_topic: "vacuum/downstairs/state"
#     json_attributes_topic: "vacuum/downstairs/map_data_parsed"
#     name: Downstairs Vacuum Map
#     value_template: 'OK'
#     # scan_interval: 5

# Alternatively, using the camera integration is another option and
# simply pull the image from valetudo-mapper. I'll do that when I can finally
# get valetudo-mapper to work... https://github.com/rand256/valetudo/issues/135
