# Currently, the majority of presence information is determined by
# the UniFi component. The primary disadvantage is that the time to
# update statuses is a bit longer than I would like, and has resulted
# in situations where the alarm system has not disarmed because one of
# our phones has not yet joined the network, or UniFi has not reported
# the update yet. Testing Owntracks to see if this will be a more
# accurate location tracking solution.
