    alias: 'Function - Light - Transition'
    description: |
      This script will transition a light based upon a set of given parameters.
      Most Z-Wave dimmer switches don't support any sort of transition effects.
      This script is to fix that by generating a fuckload more traffic on the
      Z-Wave network because this is absolutely not how this is supposed to be
      done and why it's something most Z-wave devices don't normally support.
