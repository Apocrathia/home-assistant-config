# Home Assistant Remote

# This configuration is to link a remote Raspberry Pi running HA and connected
# to various USB-based radios. This is because the production instance is
# running on a VMware ESXi cluster in my basement, and the rack effectively
# acts as a farraday cage.

# See the repository for more information
# https://github.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote
# This was *almost* added as a core integration. Maybe some day...
# https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/pull/13876
# Until then, this needs to be installed as a custom_copmponent (use HACS)
